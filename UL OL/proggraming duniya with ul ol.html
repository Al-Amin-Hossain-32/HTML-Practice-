                                                (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.</p><br>
                                            <p>Unlike others, the free-to-use and open-source full-stack Python framework include a grand number of built-in features rather than offering them as individual libraries. Django makes use of its ORM for mapping objects to database tables.
        
                                                This results in allowing the code to work across different databases as well as making it easier to migrate from one database to the other. Though Django has inherent support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle Database, it can support other databases via third-party drivers.</p>

                                                Applications designed with Dash are web servers that run Flask and communicate with JSON packets via HTTP requests. Their frontend renders components using ReactJS. Flask plugins can be used for extending the capabilities of Dash.</p><br>
                                            <p>Because Dash apps are rendered in the web browser and can be deployed to servers, they are cross-platform and mobile-ready. Dash developers are provided access to the underlying Flask instance as well as all of its configurable properties.</p>

Unlike other Python frameworks that require loading a lot of dependencies for building HTTP APIs, Falcon allows developers to build a cleaner design that enables HTTP and REST architectures.

                                                As per the benchmark test conducted by Sanic, Falcon is able to handle most requests with the same hardware than all its contemporaries. The Python framework aims to have 100% code coverage. Falcon is used by big players like LinkedIn, OpenStack, and RackSpace.</p>

Inspired by the Sinatra Ruby framework, the microframework requires Jinja2 template and Werkzeug WSGI toolkit. Thanks to its lightweight and modular design, Flask is readily adaptable.

                                                Flask allows the developers to build a solid web application foundation from where it is possible to use any kind of extensions required. The micro-framework is compatible with Google App Engine.</p>
